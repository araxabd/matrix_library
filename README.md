# Matrix Library
a library which supports lots of matrix and vector operations. A final project for CS-term1 in University of Guilan.

## Who am i ?
Arian Abdollahian, CS student in University of Guilan. Student number : 1404010121039.

## Implementation
The project is implemented with c++ but with c-style programming. It uses two-dimensional array&pointers as matrices and one-dimensional array&pointer for vectors. The header file is declarations of functions and a little explanation about their arguments (in commented lines).

The demonstration file is just an example of using this library and it uses HTML to output a file and show the results of operations.
It has an interactive command-line interface to choose and do the operation you want.

## TODO
- [ ] show broken operations in html file better
- [ ] better error handling for demonstration and memory allocation failures.
- [ ] better style for HTML output
- [ ] better design for the file structure and use structs for matrix and vector
